## Project Overview

This automation generates a fully structured Google Drive workspace immediately after a new client onboarding submission.

The system:

- Creates a dedicated client folder  
- Places it within a centralized directory  
- Replicates predefined templates using batch API requests  
- Applies a standardized folder hierarchy  
- Prepares the environment for operational use  

The workflow transforms onboarding into scalable infrastructure.

## Business Problem

Client onboarding often requires manual workspace preparation:

- Creating client folders  
- Rebuilding folder hierarchies  
- Copying onboarding documents  
- Organizing trackers and resources  

This process is time-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. As client volume increases, onboarding delays impact operational efficiency.

## Solution Summary

The automation system consists of:

1. Google Forms — captures onboarding requests  
2. Zapier — orchestrates workflow execution  
3. Google Drive API — creates folders programmatically  
4. Batch HTTP requests — replicate templates efficiently  
5. Structured folder provisioning — enforces standardized architecture  

The system provisions a ready-to-use client workspace automatically.
