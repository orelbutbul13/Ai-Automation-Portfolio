## 🧠 Project Overview

This automation instantly generates a fully structured Google Drive workspace after a new client onboarding submission.

The system:

- Creates a dedicated client folder  
- Places it within a centralized directory  
- Replicates predefined templates using batch API requests  
- Applies a standardized folder architecture  
- Prepares the environment for immediate operational use  

The workflow transforms onboarding into scalable infrastructure.

## 🚨 Business Problem

Client onboarding often requires manual workspace preparation:

- Creating client folders  
- Rebuilding folder hierarchies  
- Copying onboarding documents  
- Organizing trackers and resources  

This process is time-intensive, error-prone, difficult to scale, and operationally inefficient.

As client volume grows, these inefficiencies delay project kickoff.

## 💡 Solution Summary

An automated provisioning workflow built with:

1. **Google Forms** — captures onboarding requests  
2. **Zapier** — orchestrates automation flow  
3. **Google Drive API** — creates folders programmatically  
4. **Batch HTTP Requests** — replicates templates efficiently  
5. **Dynamic Folder Provisioning** — enforces consistent structure  

The system provisions a ready-to-use client workspace instantly.
