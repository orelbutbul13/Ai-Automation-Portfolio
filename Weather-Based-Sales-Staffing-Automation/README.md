## Project Overview

This automation replaces reactive planning with data-driven insights by:

- Retrieving real-time and forecast weather data via API  
- Analyzing environmental conditions using an AI model  
- Applying conditional logic to evaluate staffing and sales impact  
- Translating signals into operational recommendations  
- Delivering automated notifications via email  

The system enables proactive business planning without manual monitoring.

## Business Problem

Weather-sensitive businesses often struggle with:

- Late reaction to demand changes  
- Manual monitoring of forecasts  
- Overstaffing or understaffing  
- Inefficient operational planning  

These challenges increase labor costs and reduce revenue opportunities.

## Solution Summary

The automation system consists of:

1. Scheduled trigger (Zapier) — executes daily  
2. Weather API — retrieves live and forecast data  
3. AI model (Gemini / LLM) — evaluates conditions and impact  
4. Conditional decision logic — calculates staffing and sales adjustments  
5. Gmail automation — delivers operational insights  

The system converts environmental data into actionable business decisions.
