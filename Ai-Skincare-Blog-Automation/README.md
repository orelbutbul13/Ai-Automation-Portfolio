## Project Overview

This automation replaces a fully manual weekly blog creation process by:

- Retrieving blog topics and keywords from Google Sheets  
- Researching skincare themes using an AI model  
- Generating structured long-form content  
- Refining clarity, tone, and formatting automatically  
- Writing publish-ready posts back into Google Sheets  

The system demonstrates scalable, AI-driven content production.

## Business Problem

Producing consistent weekly content requires:

- Ongoing topic research  
- Clear and accurate writing  
- Structured formatting  
- Repeating the same workflow regularly  

Manual execution is time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale.

## Solution Summary

The automation system consists of:

1. Google Sheets — stores topics and control fields  
2. Make (Integromat) — orchestrates workflow execution  
3. AI model (Gemini / LLM) — performs research and content generation  
4. Prompt engineering — enforces structured, role-based outputs  
5. Structured output — final blog post written back to Sheets

## Tech Stack

- Make (Integromat) — workflow orchestration  
- Google Sheets — structured control layer  
- Gemini / LLM — content generation and reasoning  
- Prompt engineering — structured output design

## Workflow Architecture

Trigger → Topic Retrieval → AI Research → Draft Generation → Refinement → Structured Output

1. Weekly or manual trigger executed  
2. Blog topics retrieved from Google Sheets  
3. AI expands and researches themes  
4. Structured draft generated  
5. Tone and clarity refinement applied  
6. Final post written back to Google Sheets
