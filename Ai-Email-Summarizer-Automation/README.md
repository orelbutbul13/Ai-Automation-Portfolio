## Project Overview

This automation reduces manual email review by:

- Detecting new Gmail messages automatically  
- Summarizing email content using an AI model  
- Extracting key actionable insights  
- Applying conditional filtering and classification logic  
- Storing structured summaries in Google Sheets  

The system enables efficient email triage without requiring users to read every message in full.

## Business Problem

High email volume creates operational inefficiencies:

- Excessive time spent reviewing non-critical emails  
- Difficulty identifying priority messages  
- Manual organization and categorization  
- Lack of structured tracking and visibility  

These challenges reduce productivity and increase cognitive load.

## Solution Summary

The automation system consists of:

1. Gmail Trigger — detects new incoming emails  
2. AI model (LLM) — summarizes content and extracts key details  
3. Conditional filtering logic — evaluates emails against predefined criteria  
4. Path routing — processes emails based on classification  
5. Google Sheets storage — records structured summaries
